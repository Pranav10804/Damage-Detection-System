Website deploying models for
1. Detecting damage in images of destruction caused by disasters like Earthquakes/Tsunamis.
2. Classifying the severity of damage in 5 classes.
User can submit images and have severity analysis as well as detection results.

### ML Model

For inference, weights file 'best.pth' is used and the github repository https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7â€‹ must be cloned

### How to Use
The manage.py must be execited through terminal, and the link provided for the local host is to used with the extention '../homepage'
